# Library Carpentry @ Library of Congress

This site contains information and files about the Library Carpentry workshop scheduled
September 24-25, 2019, at the Library of Congress. 

For details about the times, locations, and instructors, please see 
the website at https://morskyjezek.github.io/2019-09-24-libraryofcongress/.

## Setup

For details about setup, please see the instructions at https://morskyjezek.github.io/2019-09-24-libraryofcongress/#setup. 

For Library of Congress staff who will use a Library of Congress computer, please confirm that 
you have installed and can use the following: 

* Atom (text editor)
* Git Bash
* OpenRefine
* Anaconda Navigator (will allow you to run Jupyter notebooks and work with the interactive Python editor)

Please follow instructions as noted in Jesse's email of 16 September, for details 
about how to request and run these on an LC laptop. Most of the details that you will find
on the workshop page are true, but keep in mind that you should follow the approved
method of install software so that you do not receive a request to remove it later on.
